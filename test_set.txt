edits for test:
================

- only using first ten real PFams

- in PF00198, added the following fake seqs:
  > DUPLICATE_PF00198_ODO2_STAA8/192-420
  > DUPLICATE_Q3A0D1_SYNC1/165-395
  > SHORT_PEPTIDE
  > INVALID_CHARS

- in PF00244.seed, added the following fake seqs:
  > DUPLICATE_PF00198_ODO2_STAA8/192-420 (a duplicate sequence from another Pfam)

- added the following new pfam seed file: PF99999.seed
  > has two sequences, but one should get removed because it's a short peptide
  > THEN whole pfam should be removed from the dataset, because it only has one sequence

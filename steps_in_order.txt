download files and gunzip:
=================================
alignments: 
-----------
wget "https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/releases/Pfam36.0/Pfam-A.seed.gz" && \
gunzip Pfam-A.seed.gz

trees: 
-------
wget "https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/releases/Pfam36.0/trees.tgz" && \
tar -xzvf trees.tgz && \
mv nfs/production/agb/pfam/sequpd/36.0/Release/36.0/trees .













putative new order:
[X] split seed alignments file
[X] do all MSA cleaning; track stats as you clean
   [X] remove short pepetides
   [X] remove proteins with invalid chars: B,O,U,X,Z
   [X] convert all sequences to uppercase
   [X] remove duplicates within and across MSAs
[X] check if MSA only has one sequence left
[X] fix all trees when done cleaning
[X] find pfams that are missing trees; externally need to use FastTree to replace these
